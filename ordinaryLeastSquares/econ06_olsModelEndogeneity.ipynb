The test works by comparing the OLS residuals with the predicted values of the endogenous variable obtained from the first-stage regression (regressing the endogenous variable on the instruments). If the instruments are valid, the OLS residuals should be uncorrelated with the predicted values, as they should not contain any endogeneity. |\n",
